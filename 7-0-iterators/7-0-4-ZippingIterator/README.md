Zipping iterator

Input:
1. Iterator over type A
2. Iterator over type B
3. Function which takes arguments of type A and B and returns instance of type C


Task: Implement an iterator, which takes value from two input iterators and combines them with function (to have a resulting type C). If there are no more elements in one of the iterators, the target iterator completes.
There are no code examples for this task, try to find the correct type for the function; try to use different functions.
